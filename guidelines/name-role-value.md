This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.2](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value#intent) (also provided below), replacing the note with: “This success criterion is primarily for software developers who develop or use custom user interface components. For example, standard user interface components on most accessibility-supported platforms already meet this success criterion when used according to specification.”.
