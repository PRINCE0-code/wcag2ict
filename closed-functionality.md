Comments on Closed Functionality
--------------------------------

As noted in the Introduction, WCAG 2 assumes the presence of a “user agent” such as a browser, media player, or assistive technology as a means to access web content. Many of the success criteria in WCAG 2 assume web content will be accessed by ICT where assistive technologies can be connected to it or installed on it. The assistive technologies then present the web content to people with disabilities in an accessible form. 
  
ICT with [closed functionality](#closed-functionality) does not allow the use of some assistive technologies for some or all of their functions. In many cases such ICT also lacks a “user agent” or its equivalent. To the extent the ICT is closed, following the WCAG success criteria by themselves will not make the software accessible. Where assistive technologies or user agents are not available to address the intent of these success criteria, something else needs to be provided or be required to facilitate accessibility as WCAG 2 intends. It is outside the [WCAG2ICT Task Force Work Statement](http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/wcag2ict/work-statement) to say what the additional measures are, but WCAG2ICT points out which success criteria depend on assistive technologies—and therefore would not work by themselves in a closed functionality context.

In developing guidance for closed functionality, the task force has considered examples of ICT that historically have been partially or fully closed to assistive technologies:

* self-service transaction machines or kiosks (e.g. retail self-checkout, point of sales (POS) terminals, and Automated Teller Machines (ATMs))
* telephony devices (e.g. IP phones, feature phones, and smartphones)
* entertainment technologies (e.g. smart TV, set-top box, smart watches)
* ebook reader
* computer that is locked down due to a policy so that users may not adjust settings or install software
* other technology devices (e.g. printers, displays, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices).

There are existing standards that provide accessibility requirements for both hardware and software aspects of closed functionality ICT. This document does not comment on those standards, but does note that WCAG success criteria should not be used as requirements for hardware aspects of closed functionality ICT. Instead, WCAG2ICT provides considerations for applying WCAG success criteria to software on closed functionality ICT. It also indicates where and why that might be problematic due to the underlying assumptions built into the WCAG success criteria. See [Appendix A: Success Criteria Problematic for Closed Functionality](#success-criteria-problematic-for-closed-functionality) for a list of success criteria for which this is relevant.
