From [Success Criterion @@ x.x.x @@](@@ URL for the SC in WCAG 2.2 @@):

>@@ Copy in text of the SC from [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) along with any notes. Use markdown to format properly, as needed. @@

##### Additional Guidance When Applying Success Criterion @@ x.x.x @@ to Non-Web Documents and Software:

***
_**Instructional note**: Analyze the text of the SC for words such as "Web", "page", "content", "pages", "user agent", "markup" which will key you into the need for substitution verbiage. Use one of the following statements, depending on what you think is correct and remove the bullet markdown. Add the following to the bullet if the SC refers to Conformance Requirement 5: @@ , and removing “See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference”. @@_
***

- This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion @@ x.x.x @@](@@ URL of WCAG 2.2 understanding#intent @@) (also provided below).
- This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion @@ x.x.x @@](@@ URL of WCAG 2.2 understanding#intent @@) (also provided below), replacing “@@ Web-focused language @@” with “@@ replacement non-web language @@”, “@@ page-related language @@” with “@@ appropriate non-web language @@”.

With these substitutions, it would read:  @@ Omit this line if no substitutions are needed. @@

> @@ Add in the SC text with the substitutions made. Omit this line if no substitutions are needed. @@ 

***
_**Instructional note**: If you think notes are needed for specific areas of difficulty (platform software, software with closed functionality, documents, mobile software, etc.), add them.  When multiple notes are needed, number them starting with **Note 1:** The Task Force will have a discussion for every SC for the potential to add any notes and review thoughts you have on potential notes._
***

> **Note:** @@ Whatever note is needed. Omit this line if not needed. @@
