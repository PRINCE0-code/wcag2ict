name: Template for Success Criterion
about: Adds guidance on how to open issues for specific success criteria
title: 'Success Criterion @@ x.x.x @@: @@ Short name @@ (Level @@ x @@)'
labels: ''
assignees: ''

_**Instructional note**: Places where the text needs to be replaced are denoted using "@@" (two at signs) so you can easily search for and know what to change. For example, on the first line of the template:_
* _where "@@ x.x.x @@" is found, replace that text with the Success Criterion number. (e.g. 1.1.1)_
* _where "@@ Short name @@ is found, replace with the short name of the Success Criterion (e.g. Non-text Content)_
* _where "@@ x @@" is found, replace with the SC level. (e.g. A)_

When completed, it would read: 

**Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content (Level A)**

From [Success Criterion @@ x.x.x @@](@@ URL for the SC in WCAG 2.2 @@):

>@@ Copy in text of the SC from [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) along with any notes. Use [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to format properly, as needed. @@

##### Applying SC @@ x.x.x @@ @@shortname@@ to Non-Web Documents and Software

***
_**Instructional note**: Analyze the text of the SC for words such as "Web", "page", "content", "pages", "user agent", "markup" which will key you into the need for substitution verbiage. Use one of the following statements, depending on what you think is correct and remove the bullet markdown. Add the following to the bullet if the SC refers to Conformance Requirement 5: @@ , and removing “See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference”. @@_

- This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion @@ x.x.x @@](@@ URL of WCAG 2.2 understanding#intent @@) (also provided below), replacing “@@ Web-focused language @@” with “@@ replacement non-web language @@”, “@@ page-related language @@” with “@@ appropriate non-web language @@”.

With these substitutions, it would read:  @@ Omit this line if no substitutions are needed. @@

> @@ Add in the SC text with the substitutions made. Omit this line if no substitutions are needed. @@

_**Instructional note**: If you think notes are needed for specific areas of difficulty (platform software, software with closed functionality, documents, mobile software, etc.), add them.  When multiple notes are needed, number them starting with **Note 1:** The Task Force will have a discussion for every SC for the potential to add any notes and review thoughts you have on potential notes._
