Text / Command-line / Terminal Applications and Interfaces
----------------------------------------------------------

Text applications are a class of software ICT that appeared decades ago, prior to the emergence of the graphical user interface (GUI) and the Web. The interface of a text application is generated using only text characters, and either a hardware terminal or a software terminal application handles the rendering of the text application—similar to how a web user agent handles the rendering of a web application. Text applications only accept text input, though some may also support the use of a mouse. More recently, terminal applications which render text applications in the GUI may utilize spoken input through Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) (or other input devices). Both GUI and native text environment interfaces also now commonly support word-completion prediction technologies. We note further that command-line applications are a subset of text applications with further specific properties.

Historically, assistive technologies developed alongside text applications, and several of these use a variety of analysis and scripting techniques to make text applications accessible. Although there are far fewer new text applications being developed compared to new GUI or web applications, text applications remain in use today. In fact command-line interfaces have seen a resurgence in recent years especially in popular programming and revision tracking environments. In some cases this has precipitated renewed developments in  assistive technology support for text applications.

Though this class of applications predates the Web, WCAG can be applied to them. As noted in [Appendix B. Background on Text / Command-line / Terminal Applications and Interfaces](#background-on-text-command-line-terminal-applications-and-interfaces), applying WCAG to text / command-line applications involves understanding how text applications are rendered, how text applications have been made accessible via assistive technologies, and how to apply the concepts of “accessibility supported” and “programmatically determined” to text applications.
