## Security Considerations

This Working Group Note does not introduce any new security considerations. However, when implementing WCAG 2 success criteria in the context of non-web ICT, accessibility features could potentially be exploited to bypass software security features. It is best practice to choose implementations that reduce the potential for unauthorized access (e.g. ability to bypass logins and CAPTCHAs) or introduction of malicious software by cyberattackers.

The [WCAG 2 Security Considerations section](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#security-summary) lists specific success criteria with possible implications for security, which could also exist for non-web ICT.</div>
