This is a Technical Report on Applying WCAG 2 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT). The intent of this work is to update the existing guidance to include WCAG 2.1 and 2.2 success criteria.

The current draft includes guidance for all of the WCAG 2 success criteria from WCAG 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2. The next draft will also address open issues on WCAG 2.0 criteria. 

The group is seeking feedback on the following aspects:

- Guidance for WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.2 success criteria and glossary term definitions
- Updates to the closed functionality guidance for WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.2 success criteria
