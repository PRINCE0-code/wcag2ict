This is an Editors' Draft [change to First Public Working Draft for publication] of Guidance on Applying WCAG 2.2 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT). The intent of this work is to update the existing guidance based on new WCAG 2.1 and 2.2 success criteria.

The current draft includes guidance for WCAG 2.1 success criteria. Guidance on WCAG 2.2 success criteria will be added later this year as WCAG 2.2 becomes a W3C Recommendation.

The group is seeking feedback on the following aspects:

- New added guidance for WCAG 2.1 success criteria
- [Placeholder for closed functionality and terminal applications in case we manage to include them]

The group is already aware of the differences in how the WCAG quoted passages are included with respec to the previous WCAG2ICT Working Group Note.

Known issues include:

- Links to fragments of WCAG don't currently work
- The words "Note" and "Example" are missing from notes and examples of quoted WCAG passages
- The left bar that used to be present in the previous WCAG2ICT Working Group Note is not currently present

The group is currently working on updates to the format, styling, and linking for these passages, and expects to refine these in a future draft.
