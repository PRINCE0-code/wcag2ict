## Privacy Considerations

This Working Group Note does not introduce any new privacy considerations. However, when implementing WCAG 2 success criteria in the context of non-web ICT, information about a userâ€™s accessibility needs or preferences might be exposed; a user could be harmed by disclosure and misuse of that information. It is best practice to choose implementations that reduce the potential for fingerprinting or other identification and tracking of users, and that the only data collected is data necessary to enable the accessibility features.
