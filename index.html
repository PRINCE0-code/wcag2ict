			<h2>Comments by Guideline and Success Criterion</h2>
			<p>The sections that follow are organized according to the principles, guidelines, and success criteria from WCAG 2.2. The text of each item from WCAG 2.2 is copied as quoted text. Following that, the WCAG2ICT guidance is provided. Finally, the “Intent” from Understanding WCAG 2.2 is copied as quoted text; the Task Force makes no substitutions or edits in this text. In visual presentations, the WCAG2ICT guidance is set out in a box with a blue bar to the left, to highlight that this is the content specific to this document.</p>

So the mechanism used to navigate between elements of the set will be one way of locating information in the set. Non-web environments, generally major operating systems with browse and search capabilities, often provide infrastructure and tools that provide mechanisms for locating content in a set of non-web documents or a set of software programs. For example, it may be possible to browse through the files or programs that make up a set, or search within members of the set for the names of other members. A file directory would be the equivalent of a site map for documents in a
								set, and a search function in a file system would be equivalent to a web search function for web pages. Such facilities may provide additional ways of locating information in the set.</p>
							<p class="note">An example of the use of “a software program that is part of process”, that would meet the exception for this Success Criterion, would be one where programs are interlinked but the interlinking depends on program A being used before program B, for validation or to initialize the dataset etc. </p>
							<p class="note">While some users may find it useful to have multiple ways to locate some groups of user interface elements within a document or software program, this is not required by the success criterion (and may pose difficulties in some situations).</p>
							<p class="note">The definitions of “<a href="http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_-documents">set of documents</a>” and “<a href="http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_set-of-software-programs">set of software programs</a>” in WCAG2ICT require every item in the set to be independently reachable, and so nothing in such a set can be a “step in a process” that can't be reached any other way. The purpose of the exception—that items in a process are exempt from meeting this success criterion—is achieved by the definition of set.</p>

Software sometimes uses markup languages internally for persistence of the software user interface, in ways where the markup is never available to assistive technology (either directly or through a document object model (DOM)), or to a user agent (such as a browser).

							<p class="note">For conforming to this success criterion, it is usually best practice for software user interfaces to use the accessibility services provided by platform software. These accessibility services enable interoperability between software user interfaces and both assistive technologies and accessibility features of software in standardized ways. Most platform accessibility services go beyond programmatic exposure of name and role, and programmatic setting of states, properties and values (and notification of same), and specify additional information that could or should be exposed and / or set (for instance, a list of the available actions for a given user interface component, and a means to programmatically execute one of the listed actions).</p>
							<p class="note">For document formats that support interoperability with assistive technology, standard user interface components often meet this success criterion when used according to the general design and accessibility guidance for the document format.</p>
