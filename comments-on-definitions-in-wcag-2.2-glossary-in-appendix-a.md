accessibility supported
-----------------------

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for accessibility supported](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-accessibility-supported):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “accessibility supported” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This applies directly as written and as described in the WCAG 2.2 glossary, replacing “browsers and other user agents” with “user agents or other software”, replacing “user agents” with “user agents or other software”, replacing “web content technology” with “non-web document or software technology”, adding “or other software extension” after “plug-in”, and replacing all five of the Notes with a single new Note: “Note: The concepts behind the five Notes and in Understanding Accessibility Supported are applicable to web technologies. The same or similar factors are applicable for non-web technologies.”

With these substitutions and addition, it would read:

accessibility supported

supported by users' [assistive technologies](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_at "WCAG2ICT Definition: assistive technologies") as well as the accessibility features in [user agents](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_useragent "WCAG2ICT Definition: user agents") or other [software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_software "WCAG2ICT Definition: software")

To qualify as an accessibility-supported use of a [non-web document](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_document "WCAG2ICT Definition: non-web document") or [software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_software "WCAG2ICT Definition: software")[technology](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_technology "WCAG2ICT Definition: technology") (or feature of a technology), both 1 and 2 must be satisfied for a [non-web document](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_document "WCAG2ICT Definition: non-web document") or [software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_software "WCAG2ICT Definition: software")[technology](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_technology "WCAG2ICT Definition: technology") (or feature):

1.  **The way that the [non-web document](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_document "WCAG2ICT Definition: non-web document") or [software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_software "WCAG2ICT Definition: software")[technology](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_technology "WCAG2ICT Definition: technology") is used must be supported by users' assistive technology (AT).** This means that the way that the technology is used has been tested for interoperability with users' assistive technology in the [human language(s)](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-human-language-s "WCAG Definition: human language(s)") of the [content](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_content "WCAG2ICT Definition: content"),
    
    **AND**
    
2.  **The [non-web document](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_document "WCAG2ICT Definition: non-web document") or [software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_software "WCAG2ICT Definition: software")[technology](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_technology "WCAG2ICT Definition: technology") must have accessibility-supported user agents or other [software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_software "WCAG2ICT Definition: software") that are available to users.** This means that at least one of the following four statements is true:
    
    1.  The [technology](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_technology "WCAG2ICT Definition: technology") is supported natively in widely-distributed user agents or other [software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_software "WCAG2ICT Definition: software") that are also accessibility supported (such as HTML and CSS);
        
        **OR**
        
    2.  The [technology](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_technology "WCAG2ICT Definition: technology") is supported in a widely-distributed plug-in or other software extension that is also accessibility supported;
        
        **OR**
        
    3.  The [content](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_content "WCAG2ICT Definition: content") is available in a closed environment, such as a university or corporate network, where the user agent or other [software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_software "WCAG2ICT Definition: software") required by the technology and used by the organization is also accessibility supported;
        
        **OR**
        
    4.  The user agent(s) that support the [technology](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_technology "WCAG2ICT Definition: technology") are accessibility supported and are available for download or purchase in a way that:
        
        *   does not cost a person with a disability any more than a person without a disability **and**
            
        *   is as easy to find and obtain for a person with a disability as it is for a person without disabilities.
            

The concepts behind the five Notes and in [Understanding Accessibility Supported](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance#accessibility-support) are applicable to web technologies. The same or similar factors are applicable for non-web technologies.

ambiguous to users in general
-----------------------------

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for ambiguous to users in general](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-ambiguous-to-users-in-general):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “ambiguous to users in general” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This applies directly as written and as described in the WCAG 2.2 glossary, replacing “Web page” with “non-web document or software”.

With this substitution, it would read:

ambiguous to users in general

the purpose cannot be determined from the link and all information of the [non-web document](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_document "WCAG2ICT Definition: non-web document") or [software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_software "WCAG2ICT Definition: software") presented to the user simultaneously with the link (i.e., readers without disabilities would not know what a link would do until they activated it)

_Example:_ The word guava in the following sentence “One of the notable exports is guava” is a link. The link could lead to a definition of guava, a chart listing the quantity of guava exported or a photograph of people harvesting guava. Until the link is activated, all readers are unsure and the person with a disability is not at any disadvantage.

assistive technology (as used in this document)
-----------------------------------------------

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for assistive technology (as used in this document)](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-assistive-technologies):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “assistive technology (as used in this document)” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This applies directly as written and as described in the WCAG 2.2 glossary, replacing “acts as a user agent” with “acts stand-alone”, replacing “mainstream user agent\[s\]” with “mainstream information and communication technologies (ICT)” (later “mainstream ICT\[s\])”, and replacing “Web content” with “content”.

With these substitutions, it would read:

assistive technology (as used in this document)

hardware and/or software that acts stand-alone, or along with mainstream information and communication technologies (ICT), to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream ICT

functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g., voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations (e.g., to make tables more accessible).

Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream ICTs by using and monitoring APIs.

The distinction between mainstream ICTs and assistive technologies is not absolute. Many mainstream ICTs provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference is that mainstream ICTs target broad and diverse audiences that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The mainstream ICT may provide important functionality to assistive technologies like retrieving [content](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_content "WCAG2ICT Definition: content") from program objects or parsing markup into identifiable bundles.

_Example:_ Assistive technologies that are important in the context of this document include the following:

*   screen magnifiers, and other visual reading assistants, which are used by people with visual, perceptual and physical print disabilities to change text font, size, spacing, color, synchronization with speech, etc. in order to improve the visual readability of rendered text and images;
    
*   screen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information through synthesized speech or braille;
    
*   text-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech;
    
*   speech recognition software, which may be used by people who have some physical disabilities;
    
*   alternative keyboards, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate the keyboard (including alternate keyboards that use head pointers, single switches, sip/puff and other special input devices.);
    
*   alternative pointing devices, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate mouse pointing and button activations.
    

changes of context
------------------

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for changes of context](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-change-of-context):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “changes of context” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This applies directly as written and as described in the WCAG 2.2 glossary, replacing “Web page” and “page” with “non-web document or content presented by software”.

With this substitution, it would read:

changes of context

major changes in the content of the [non-web document](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_document "WCAG2ICT Definition: non-web document") or [content](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_content "WCAG2ICT Definition: content") presented by [software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_software "WCAG2ICT Definition: software") that, if made without user awareness, can disorient users who are not able to view the entire [non-web document](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_document "WCAG2ICT Definition: non-web document") or [content](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_content "WCAG2ICT Definition: content") presented by [software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_software "WCAG2ICT Definition: software") simultaneously

Changes in context include changes of:

1.  [user agent](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_useragent "WCAG2ICT Definition: user agent");
    
2.  [viewport](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_viewport "WCAG2ICT Definition: viewport");
    
3.  focus;
    
4.  [content](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_content "WCAG2ICT Definition: content") that changes the meaning of the [non-web document](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_document "WCAG2ICT Definition: non-web document") or [content](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_content "WCAG2ICT Definition: content") presented by [software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_software "WCAG2ICT Definition: software").
    

A change of [content](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_content "WCAG2ICT Definition: content") is not always a change of context. Changes in content, such as an expanding outline, dynamic menu, or a tab control do not necessarily change the context, unless they also change one of the above (e.g., focus).

_Example:_ Opening a new window, moving focus to a different component, going to a new page (including anything that would look to a user as if they had moved to a new page) or significantly re-arranging the content of a page are examples of changes of context.

a change in the user agent might include bringing up a new window, or might be a significant change in the menus and/or toolbars that are displayed and available for interacting with some portion of the document.

conformance
-----------

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for conformance](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-conform):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “conformance” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The guidance in this document does not use the term “conformance”.

See [Section 6 Comments on Conformance](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#comments-on-conformance).

conforming alternate version
----------------------------

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for conforming alternate version](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-conforming-alternate-versions):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “conforming alternate version” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The guidance in this document does not use the term “conforming alternate version”.

See [Section 6 Comments on Conformance](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#comments-on-conformance).

content (Web content)
---------------------

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for content (Web content)](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-content):

Including the term "content" a second time here causes processing errors, commented out.

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “content (Web content)” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the [guidance on content in the Key Terms section](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_content-on-and-off-the-web).

contrast ratio
--------------

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for contrast ratio](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-contrast-ratio):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “contrast ratio” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This applies directly as written and as described in the WCAG 2.2 glossary.

Because relative luminance is defined such that it cannot directly apply to hardware, please note the text in the introduction which reads: “This document does not comment on hardware aspects of products, non-UI aspects of platforms, or the application of WCAG 2.2 for user-interface components as a category, because the basic constructs on which the WCAG 2.2 and / or its conformance are built do not apply to these.”

general flash and red flash thresholds
--------------------------------------

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for general flash and red flash thresholds](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-general-flash-and-red-flash-thresholds):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “general flash and red flash thresholds” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This applies directly as written and as described in the WCAG 2.2 glossary.

because this deals with relative luminance and not luminance, it can only be applied to information on a display, not to hardware sources of light.

input error
-----------

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for input error](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-input-error):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “input error” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This applies directly as written and as described in the WCAG 2.2 glossary, replacing “Web page” with “non-web document or software”.

With this substitution, it would read:

input error

information provided by the user that is not accepted

This includes:

1.  Information that is required by the [non-web document](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_document "WCAG2ICT Definition: non-web document") or [software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_software "WCAG2ICT Definition: software") but omitted by the user
    
2.  Information that is provided by the user but that falls outside the required data format or values
    

keyboard interface
------------------

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for keyboard interface](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-keyboard-interface):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “keyboard interface” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This applies directly as written and as described in the WCAG 2.2 glossary.

Please see the note in the [guidance for Success Criterion 2.1.1](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#success-criterion-2-1-1-keyboard-level-a) that uses this definition and which reads: “This does not imply that software must directly support a keyboard or ‘keyboard interface’. Nor does it imply that software must provide a soft keyboard. Underlying platform software may provide device independent input services to applications that enable operation via a keyboard. Software that supports operation via such platform device independent services would be operable by a keyboard and would comply.”

label
-----

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for label](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-labels):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “label” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This applies directly as written and as described in the WCAG 2.2 glossary, replacing “Web Content” with “content” and adding “or by accessibility features of software” after “assistive technology” in Note 1.

With this substitution, it would read:

label

[text](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-text "WCAG Definition: text") or other component with a [text alternative](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-text-alternative "WCAG Definition: text alternative") that is presented to a user to identify a component within [content](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_content "WCAG2ICT Definition: content")

A label is presented to all users whereas the [name](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_name "WCAG2ICT Definition: name") may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology or by accessibility features of software. In many (but not all) cases the name and the label are the same.

The term label is not limited to the label element in HTML.

name
----

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for name](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-name):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “name” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This applies directly as written and as described in the WCAG 2.2 glossary, replacing “Web content” with “content” and adding “or by accessibility features of software” after “assistive technology” in Note 1.

With this substitution, it would read:

name

text by which software can identify a component within [content](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_content "WCAG2ICT Definition: content") to the user

The name may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology or by accessibility features of software, whereas a [label](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_label "WCAG2ICT Definition: label") is presented to all users. In many (but not all) cases, the label and the name are the same.

This is unrelated to the name attribute in HTML.

“AccessibleName” (or whatever it is called in different APIs) of the Accessibility API of the platform is an example of such a name.

process
-------

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for process](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-processes):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “process” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This term is only used in [success criterion 2.4.5 Multiple Ways](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#multiple-ways). The definitions of [set of documents](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_set-of-documents) and [set of software programs](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_set-of-software-programs) in WCAG2ICT require every item in the set to be independently reachable, and so nothing in such a set can be a “step in a process” that can't be reached any other way. The purpose of the term's use in [2.4.5 Multiple Ways](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#multiple-ways) (that items in a process are exempt from meeting that success criterion) is achieved by the definitions of [set of documents](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_set-of-documents) and [set of software programs](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_set-of-software-programs).

programmatically determined (programmatically determinable)
-----------------------------------------------------------

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for programmatically determined (programmatically determinable)](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-programmatically-determinable):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “programmatically determined (programmatically determinable)” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This applies directly as written and as described in the WCAG 2.2 glossary, replacing “user agents, including assistive technologies” with “assistive technologies and accessibility features of software” and adding and “accessibility features of software” after “assistive technology”.

With this substitution, it would read:

programmatically determined (programmatically determinable)

determined by [software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_software "WCAG2ICT Definition: software") from author-supplied data provided in a way that different [assistive technologies](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_at "WCAG2ICT Definition: assistive technologies") and accessibility features of software, can extract and present this information to users in different modalities

_Example 1:_ Determined in a markup language from elements and attributes that are accessed directly by commonly available assistive technology and accessibility features of software.

_Example 2:_ Determined from technology-specific data structures in a non-markup language and exposed to assistive technology and accessibility features of software via an accessibility API that is supported by commonly available assistive technology and accessibility features of software.

Software typically enables content to be programmatically determined through the use of [accessibility services of platform software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_accessibility-services). Non-web documents typically enable [content](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/wcag2ict-def_content) to be programmatically determined through the use of accessibility services of the user agent.

programmatically set
--------------------

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for programmatically set](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-programmatically-set):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “programmatically set” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This applies directly as written and as described in the WCAG 2.2 glossary, replacing “user agents, including assistive technologies” with “assistive technologies and accessibility features of software”.

With this substitution, it would read:

programmatically set

set by software using methods that are supported by [assistive technologies](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_at "WCAG2ICT Definition: assistive technologies") and accessibility features of software

Software typically enables [content](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_content) to be programmatically determined through the use of [accessibility services of platform software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_accessibility-services). Non-web documents typically enable content to be programmatically determined through the use of accessibility services of the user agent.

relative luminance
------------------

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for relative luminance](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-relative-luminance):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “relative luminance” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This applies directly as written and as described in the WCAG 2.2 glossary, replacing “Web content” with “content”.

With this substitution, it would read:

relative luminance

the relative brightness of any point in a colorspace, normalized to 0 for darkest black and 1 for lightest white

For the sRGB colorspace, the relative luminance of a color is defined as L = 0.2126 \* **R** + 0.7152 \* **G** + 0.0722 \* **B** where **R**, **G** and **B** are defined as:

*   if RsRGB <= 0.03928 then **R** = RsRGB/12.92 else **R** = ((RsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4
    
*   if GsRGB <= 0.03928 then **G** = GsRGB/12.92 else **G** = ((GsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4
    
*   if BsRGB <= 0.03928 then **B** = BsRGB/12.92 else **B** = ((BsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4
    

and RsRGB, GsRGB, and BsRGB are defined as:

*   RsRGB = R8bit/255
    
*   GsRGB = G8bit/255
    
*   BsRGB = B8bit/255
    

The “^” character is the exponentiation operator. (Formula taken from [\[sRGB\]](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#bib-srgb)).

Almost all systems used today to view [content](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_content "WCAG2ICT Definition: content") assume sRGB encoding. Unless it is known that another color space will be used to process and display the content, authors should evaluate using sRGB colorspace. If using other color spaces, see [Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum).

If dithering occurs after delivery, then the source color value is used. For colors that are dithered at the source, the average values of the colors that are dithered should be used (average R, average G, and average B).

Tools are available that automatically do the calculations when testing contrast and flash.

A [MathML version of the relative luminance definition](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/relative-luminance.html) is available.

Because relative luminance is defined such that it cannot directly apply to hardware, please note the text in the introduction which reads: “This document does not comment on hardware aspects of products, non-UI aspects of platforms, or the application of WCAG 2.2 for user-interface components as a category, because the basic constructs on which the WCAG 2.2 and / or its conformance are built do not apply to these.”

role
----

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for role](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-role):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “role” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This applies directly as written and as described in the WCAG 2.2 glossary, replacing “Web content” with “content”.

With this substitution, it would read:

role

text or number by which software can identify the function of a component within [content](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_content "WCAG2ICT Definition: content")

_Example:_ A number that indicates whether an image functions as a hyperlink, command button, or check box.

“AccessibleRole” (or however it is called in different APIs) of the Accessibility API of the platform is an example of such a role.

same functionality
------------------

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for same functionality](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-same-functionality) :

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “same functionality ” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This applies directly as written and as described in the WCAG 2.2 glossary, adding a second example (and numbering the first).

With these substitutions, it would read:

same functionality

same result when used

_Example 1:_ A submit “search” button on one web page and a “find” button on another web page may both have a field to enter a term and list topics in the Web site related to the term submitted. In this case, they would have the same functionality but would not be labeled consistently.

_Example 2:_ A ribbon icon that saves the document that looks like an arrow pointing into a folder in one case, and an arrow pointing into a hard drive in another. In this case as well, they would have the same functionality but would not be labeled consistently.

satisfies a success criterion
-----------------------------

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for satisfies a success criterion](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-satisfies):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “satisfies a success criterion” to Non-Web Documents and Software:

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for structure](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-structure):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “structure” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This applies directly as written and as described in the WCAG 2.2 glossary, replacing “a Web page” with “non-web documents or software” and replacing “collection of Web pages” with “set of documents or set of software programs”.

With these substitutions, it would read:

structure

1.  The way the parts of [non-web documents](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_document "WCAG2ICT Definition: non-web documents") or [software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_software "WCAG2ICT Definition: software") are organized in relation to each other; and
    
2.  The way a [set of documents](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_set-of-documents "WCAG2ICT Definition: set of documents") or [set of software programs](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_set-of-software-programs "WCAG2ICT Definition: set of software programs") is organized
    

See the guidance on user [sets of documents](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_set-of-documents) and [sets of software programs](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_set-of-software-programs) in the Key Terms section.

“AccessibleRole” (or however it is called in different APIs) of the Accessibility API of the platform is an example of such a role.

technology (Web content)
------------------------

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for technology (Web content)](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-technologies):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “technology (Web content)” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This applies directly as written and as described in the WCAG 2.2 glossary, replacing “web content” with “non-web document or software”, “user agents” with “user agents or other software”, removing the notes, and replacing the example with “Example: Some common examples of non-web document and software technologies include ODF, OOXML, Java, and C++.”

With these substitutions, it would read:

technology (non-web document or software)

[mechanism](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism "WCAG Definition: mechanism") for encoding instructions to be rendered, played or executed by [user agents](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_useragent "WCAG2ICT Definition: user agents") or other [software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_software "WCAG2ICT Definition: software").

_Example:_ Some common examples of non-web document and software technologies include ODF, OOXML, Java, and C++.

user agent

user interface component
------------------------

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for user interface component](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-user-interface-components):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “user interface component” to Non-Web Documents and Software:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This applies directly as written and as described in the WCAG 2.2 glossary, replacing the example with “Example: A software program has 2 controls: a text field for entering a file name and a drop down list box for choosing a folder. Each is a user interface component with a name that is settable by the software.”

With this substitution, it would read:

user interface component

a part of the [content](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_content "WCAG2ICT Definition: content") that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function

Multiple user interface components may be implemented as a single programmatic element. Components here is not tied to programming techniques, but rather to what the user perceives as separate controls.

User interface components include form elements and links as well as components generated by scripts.

_Example:_ A [software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_software "WCAG2ICT Definition: software") program has 2 controls: a text field for entering a file name and a drop down list box for choosing a folder. Each is a user interface component with a name that is settable by the [software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_software "WCAG2ICT Definition: software").

viewport
--------

From the [WCAG 2.2 definition for viewport](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-viewport):

Additional Guidance When Applying the Definition of “viewport” to Non-Web Documents and Software:

object in which the [software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_software "WCAG2ICT Definition: software") presents [content](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_content "WCAG2ICT Definition: content")

The [software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_software "WCAG2ICT Definition: software") presents [content](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_content "WCAG2ICT Definition: content") through one or more viewports. Viewports include windows, frames, loudspeakers, and virtual magnifying glasses. A viewport may contain another viewport (e.g., nested frames). Interface components created by the [software](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_software "WCAG2ICT Definition: software") such as prompts, menus, and alerts are not viewports.

This definition is based on [User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 Glossary](http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT/glossary.html).
