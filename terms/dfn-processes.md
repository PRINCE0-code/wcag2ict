This term is only used in [success criterion 2.4.5 Multiple Ways](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#multiple-ways). The definitions of [set of documents](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_set-of-documents) and [set of software programs](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_set-of-software-programs) in WCAG2ICT require every item in the set to be independently reachable, and so nothing in such a set can be a “step in a process” that can't be reached any other way. The purpose of the term's use in [2.4.5 Multiple Ways](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#multiple-ways) (that items in a process are exempt from meeting that success criterion) is achieved by the definitions of [set of documents](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_set-of-documents) and [set of software programs](http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_set-of-software-programs).
